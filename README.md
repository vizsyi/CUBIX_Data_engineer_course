## Project overview
This code was created as the final exam for the [CUBIX](https://courses.cubixedu.com/kepzesek) Data Engineering course.

The task is to analyse the taxi trips at Chicago and the weather effects.

### Process steps:

1. Extraxtion: AWS Lambda code collects the daily taxi trip data and the weather information through Web API. The data are cleaned and transformed to a csv file in a AWS S3 bucket's folder. A Python program on premise sraped the community areas of Chicago from web.

1. Transform and Load: and AWS Lambda code transforms and save the daily taxi trip and weather data to another S3 folder, updates the master data.

1. [Visual Analysis](#Visual-Analysis): Python program on premis reads back all the transformed csv files from S3 bucket and makes visualisasion using Matplotlib library.

### The sources of the data:
- [Open-Meteo - Free weather API](https://open-meteo.com/)
- [Chicago Data Portal](https://data.cityofchicago.org/)
- [Community areas in Chicago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_areas_in_Chicago)

Examined period: March 12, 2024 - April 20 (40 days)

### Used tools:
- AWS services: Lambda, S3, Glue, Crawlers, Athena
- Python 3.12.3
- Python libraries: Pandas, StringIO, OS, Request, Boto3, MatPlotLib
- Visual Studio Code
- Jupyter notebook

## Visual Analysis

### 1. Analysing the weekdays

### 2. Rain effect on the hourly trips
<p>I analysed the trips only on workdays to eliminate the difference of the weekend traffic.</p>

<p>As you can see the peak hour is between 17 and 18 o'clock.
The rain increases slightly the taxi traffic between 9 and 18 o'clock.</p>

### 3. Analysing the taxi companies in the period
